A context can be a category of items where each item has a distinct name. Search results are presented using the context based on the number of co-occurrences of the search term and terms relating to the context. In a preferred embodiment, the search results are presented as a list with documents having higher co-occurrences ordered at the top of the list. Context definition sets can be created and updated as an ongoing service to a subscriber. Several processing configurations are presented.",
